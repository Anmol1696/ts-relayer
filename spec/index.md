# Relayer Binary

The relayer binary is designed to connect to two chains, create a connection if needed,
create channels on demands, and relayer a selected subset of packets between the two chains.
It is designed to run on a secure machine and must be provided with a funded account on
each chain. If you wish to connect multiple chains, please run one (or more) relayer for
each pair you wish to connect.
